LIMITATIONS

This    chapter contains:
   ●​   Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) limitations
   ●​   AFM operational information
   ●​   Non-AFM operational information.

Limitations and operational information are included if they are:
   ●​ operationally significant
   ●​ required by FAA Airworthiness Directive
   ●​ required by another regulatory requirement.

Limitations and operational information are not included if they
are:
   ●​ incorporated into FCOM normal, supplementary, or non-normal
      procedures, with a few exceptions
   ●​ shown on a placard, display, or other marking.

Limitations and operational information listed in this chapter
that must be memorized (memory items) are marked with a (#)
symbol. They meet the following criterion - flight crew access by
reference cannot assure timely compliance, e.g., Maximum Takeoff
and Landing Tailwind Component. They need only be memorized to the
extent that compliance is assured. Knowing the exact wording of
the limitation is not required.

Assuming that the remaining items are available to the flight crew
by reference, they do not need to be memorized.

AIR SYSTEMS

AFM LIMITATIONS

The maximum      cabin       differential pressure (relief valves) is 9.1
psi.

NON-AFM OPERATIONAL INFORMATION

With either one or both engine bleed air switches ON, do not
operate the air conditioning packs in HIGH for takeoff, approach

NOTE: The fire protection Non-Normal procedures take precedence
over the statement regarding no air conditioning pack in HIGH
during  takeoff, approach, or landing. The CARGO FIRE and
SMOKE/FUMES   REMOVAL  checklists   require the   Operating  PACK
switch(es) HIGH. Switch(es) need to be placed in HIGH in order to
increase ventilation for smoke removal.

AUTOPILOT/FLIGHT DIRECTOR SYSTEM

AFM LIMITATIONS

# Use of aileron trim with the autopilot engaged is prohibited.

# Do not engage the autopilot for takeoff below 400 feet AGL.

# For single channel operation during approach,      the   autopilot
shall not remain engaged below 50 feet AGL.

# Maximum allowable wind speeds when landing weather minima are
predicated on autoland operations:
   ●​ Headwind: 25 knots
   ●​ Crosswind: 20 knots
   ●​ Tailwind: 10 knots.

# Maximum and minimum glide slope angles for Autoland are 3.25
degrees and 2.5 degrees, respectively.

# Autoland capability may only be used with flaps 30 or 40 and
both engines operative.

NON-AFM OPERATIONAL INFORMATION

# Do not use LVL CHG on final approach below 1000 feet AFE.

COMMUNICATIONS

AFM LIMITATIONS

Do not use VHF-3 (if installed for voice communication) for ATC
communications with ACARS operational.

Flights predicated on the use of the following HF frequencies are
prohibited: 29.489 and 29.490 (MHz).

NON-AFM OPERATIONAL INFORMATION

Use the VHF radio connected to the top of the fuselage antenna for
primary ATC communications on the ground.

ENGINES AND APU

AFM LIMITATIONS

ENGINE LIMIT DISPLAY MARKINGS

Maximum and minimum limits are red.

Caution limits are amber.

ENGINE IGNITION

Engine ignition must be on for:
   ●​ takeoff
   ●​ landing
   ●​ operation in heavy rain
   ●​ anti-ice operation.

THRUST

Operation with assumed temperature reduced takeoff thrust is not
permitted with anti-skid inoperative.

REVERSE THRUST

#Intentional selection of reverse thrust in flight is prohibited.

APU

#Inflight - APU bleed + electrical load: max alt 10,000 ft.

#Ground only - APU bleed + electrical load: max alt 15,000 ft.

#APU bleed: max alt 17,000 ft.

#APU electrical load: max alt 41,000 ft.

NON-AFM OPERATIONAL INFORMATION

APU bleed valve must be closed when:
   ●​ ground air connected and isolation valve open
   ●​ engine no. 1 bleed valve open
   ●​ isolation and engine no. 2 bleed valves open.

APU bleed valve may be open during engine start, but avoid engine
power above idle.

After three consecutive aborted start attempts, a fifteen-minute
cooling period is required.

Run the APU for two full minutes before using it as a bleed air
source.

FLIGHT CONTROLS

AFM LIMITATIONS

# The maximum altitude with flaps extended is 20,000 ft.

# Holding in icing conditions with flaps extended is prohibited.

In flight, do not extend the SPEED BRAKE lever beyond the FLIGHT
DETENT.

# Avoid rapid and large alternating control inputs, especially in
combination with large changes in pitch, roll, or yaw (e.g., large
side slid angles) as they may result in structural failure at any
speed, including below VA.

NON-AFM OPERATIONAL INFORMATION

# Do not deploy the speed brakes in flight at radio altitudes less
than 1,000 feet.

Alternate flap duty cycle:
   ●​ When extending or retracting flaps with the ALTERNATE FLAPS
      position switch, allow 15 seconds after releasing the
      ALTERNATE FLAPS position switch before moving the switch
      again to avoid damage to the alternate flap motor clutch.
   ●​ After a complete extend/retract cycle, i.e., 0 to 15 and back
      to 0, allow 5 minutes cooling before attempting another
      extension.

FLIGHT MANAGEMENT, NAVIGATION

AFM LIMITATIONS

AIR DATA INERTIAL REFERENCE UNIT (ADIRU)

ADIRU alignment must not be attempted at latitudes greater than 78
degrees 15 minutes.

All flight operations based on magnetic heading or magnetic track
angle are prohibited in geographic areas where the installed IRS
MagVar table errors are greater than 5 degrees.

Refer to AFM Normal Procedures/Inertial Reference System section
for procedures to determine the geographic areas and magnitude of
MagVar errors for the specific MagVar table installed in the IRS
and if any of these limitations apply.

For Fail-Operational          Autopilot, all autopilot/flight director ILS
approach and landing         operations that use magnetic north referenced
courses or bearings          are prohibited in geographic areas where the
installed IRS MagVar         table errors are greater than 3 degrees.

LOOK-AHEAD TERRAIN ALERTING (GPES)

Do not use the terrain display for navigation.

Do not use the look-ahead terrain alerting and terrain display
functions:
   ●​ within 15 nm of takeoff, approach or landing at an airport
      not contained in the GPWS terrain database.

NON-AFM OPERATIONAL INFORMATION

# Avoid weather radar operation in a hangar.

Avoid weather radar operation when personnel are within the area
normally enclosed by the aircraft nose radome.

NOTE: The hangar         recommendation    does       not   apply   to   the weather
radar test mode.

FUEL

AFM LIMITATIONS

Maximum tank fuel temperature: 49°C.

Minimum inflight take fuel temperature: 3°C above the freezing
point of the fuel being used or -43°C, whichever is higher.

NOTE: The use of Fuel System Icing Inhibitor additives does not
change the minimum fuel tank temperature limit.

Intentional dry running of a center tank fuel pump (low pressure
light illuminated) is prohibited.

FUEL BALANCE

Lateral imbalance between main tanks 1 and 2 must be scheduled to
be zero. Random fuel imbalance must not exceed 453 kgs for taxi,
takeoff, flight, or landing.
